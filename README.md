## Data evaluations & cleaning

### Contributors:

Dylan Peterson

### Description

Python code that takes 3 csv(comma separated values) file and cleans the data and also displays it in ways to see specific values in the data.

### Technologies Used:

- Python 3.7
- JupyterLabs
- Pandas

#### Programs used:
- Visual Code Studio
- WSL2 (ubuntu 20.04)
- Windows Terminal
 ### Setup & Installation:

1. Through the terminal like [GitBash](https://git-scm.com/downloads)

	2. Open the terminal and navigate to where you would like the new project to be using `cd` commands. Its also recommended that you make a new directory using `mkdir *directory-name*`.

	3. Clone the repository using the command `git clone https://github.com/DyPeterson/python_test_2.git`

	4. After cloning the directory it will appear in the directory that your terminal is set to. So make sure you are in the directory that you want this project copied to.
	6.  Once this project is cloned you can navigate to that folder within your terminal and create a virtual environment ' python3.7 -m venv |any-name|'. Now activate the venv with `source venv/bin/activate`
	7. Install requirements in venv `pip install -r requirements.txt`
	8. `code .` to open in coding software or `python3.7 main.py` to run through the terminal.
3. Through github.com

4. Go to the project's directory page **[HERE](https://github.com/DyPeterson/python_test_2.git)**

5. Click the green `code` button to open the drop-down menu.

6. At the bottom of the menu will have *Download Zip*. Go ahead and click it to download the project.

7. Once downloaded find the `.zip` file and right-click it to bring up the menu. Within that menu click `Extract Here` to extract it in the current folder or click `Extract Files...`to select which folder you would like the project in.

8. Once the project has been extracted, locate the folder in a terminal and open it with `code .` or alternatively `python3.7 main.py` to run through the terminal.

### Details

This project was made for a independent code review at [Epicodus](https://www.epicodus.com/). It's intention is to show what I have learned in the past week and to demonstrate it to an instructor. This week we were asked to use Python and Pandas to meet the following objectives

1. Profile the data with ```head() tail() .shape``` & describe in comments what they do.

2. Use a `.loc` function to show a specific series of data.

3. Remove all duplicate rows from the data.

4. Give the Songs and Artists unique IDs
5. Use a `map()` function to remove empty fields and replace them with a `NaN` object.
6.  Remove a specific column from a dataframe.
7.  Join two pairs of dataframes together & show the results.
8. Use Pandas to calculate a descending list of occurrences
9. (not required) *Bonus* Check the occurrences of albums released in each year, with a descending list to display the values.

Thank you for checking out my project. If you would like to contact me, you can do so by emailing me at <dylan.peterson17@gmail.com>
